  summary: |
    CadQuery is a parametric scripting language for creating and traversing
    CAD models
  description: |
    CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use python library for building
    parametric 3D CAD models. It has several goals:
    - Build models with scripts that are as close as possible to how youâ€™d
      describe the object to a human, using a standard, already established
      programming language
    - Create parametric models that can be very easily customized by end users
    - Output high quality CAD formats like STEP and AMF in addition to
      traditional STL
    - Provide a non-proprietary, plain text model format that can be edited and
      executed with only a web browser
